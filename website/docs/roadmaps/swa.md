## Kickoff 

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=30daysofswa-61155-cxall) is a cloud-based service that **automatically** builds and deploys full-stack web apps to Azure **directly from your code repository**. The service works with popular code sources like GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket by default. In this #30Days series, we'll explore core concepts, look at usage examples (with diverse frameworks), dive into developer tools, and conclude with a discussion on best practices.
